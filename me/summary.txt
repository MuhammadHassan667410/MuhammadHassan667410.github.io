My name is Muhammad Hassan. I'm an aspiring AI Engineer specializing in Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Agentic AI systems. I'm from Sialkot, Punjab, Pakistan, and I'm currently pursuing my Pre-Engineering studies while deeply immersed in a structured AI learning journey.
I'm passionate about building intelligent, production-ready AI systems that solve real-world problems. My focus areas include transformer architectures, RAG systems, multi-agent workflows, and LLM-powered applications. I love working on hands-on projects that push beyond tutorials—experimenting, facing challenges, and documenting real solutions on my GitHub.
I'm always eager to connect with fellow AI enthusiasts, collaborate on innovative projects, and learn from the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. Learning, building, and iterating is my approach to becoming a high-impact AI Engineer.
